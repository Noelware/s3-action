# â˜• Contributing to this GitHub action

Thanks for stopping by and reading this! I'm going to assume you want to contribute to this GitHub Action!

Before you do, you must read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before continuing to make sure what
the conduct is before submitting an issue or Pull Request.

## Requirements

If you wish to tamper with the code, you will need:

- Node.js v16 or higher

If you want to just edit some documentation, you can visit [github.dev](https://github.dev/Noelware/s3-action) to open up Visual Studio Code to edit the documentation!~

## Tips

- Make sure when you're submitting an issue or PR, it isn't a duplicate of a pre-existing issue/PR.
- Make sure you're using the right labels when submitting an issue or pull request;
  - Use the `bug` label if this contains fixes of a bug.
  - Use the `documentation` label if this issue/PR is cleaning up documentation.
  - Use the `enhancement` label if this issue/PR considers breaking changes via binary/API.
  - If you're using the wrong labels, the contributors might edit the labels to be correct!
- Be clear and concise with the title, issue/PR body, so it'll be easier to link other issues/PRs with solutions!
- Specify on how we can reproduce the bug. If you can't really, then it'll be impossible to fix it (aka it works on my machine:tm:)
- Clarify the library version, what environments you're using (Java Version, Kotlin Version, Gradle Version).

Have fun contributing!~ ^3^
